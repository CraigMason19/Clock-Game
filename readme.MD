- Made using TypeScript / JavaScript, CSS & HTML

More information on **IANA** time zones can be found [here](https://www.iana.org).

## About

A simple game that makes you guess between three analog clocks to find the correct time for a random location. 
 
After guessing correctly a link to google is shown to see these places. Makes you realize how many places on Earth you have never heard of and they usually have some interesting buildings / monuments / landscapes.
